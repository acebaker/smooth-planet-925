<p id="program">Within the UW Division of Design there are three majors—Visual Communication Design,
Industrial Design and Design Studies—as well as a series of courses in Interaction Design.
The division educates and trains designers to create and develop concepts that optimize the function,
value, and appearance of communications, products and systems.</p>
<div id="columncontainer">
<div class="column">
<ul>
<li class="title">Visual Communication Design</li>
<li>Visual Communication Design educates and trains designers for the 
communication needs of industry and society. 
Students integrate methodology, aesthetics, 
technology, materials and audience to 
develop strategies and solutions. These 
take the form of print, screen and the 
built environment.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="title">Design Studies</li>
<li>Design Studies examines design within a multi-disciplinary context. 
Coursework includes design theory, methodology and 
case studies, and culminates in a two-course 
capstone project. Students combine a cross-disciplinary 
perspective with research, writing and a high level 
of visual literacy.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="title">Industrial Design</li>
<li>Industrial Design makes innovative concepts tangible in the form 
of products. These take the form of tools, environments 
or services that are meaningful and useful for society. 
Observation skills, technical knowledge, and human 
factors principles all form part of a rich and 
systematic design process.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="column">
<ul>
<li class="title">Master of Fine Arts</li>
<li>The Master of Fine Arts program is a two-year course leading to a masters 
degree in industrial design, visual communication 
design and interaction design. In a cross-disciplinary 
environment students develop their conceptual skills, 
experimenting with media and conducting personal design 
investigation on an advanced level.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="title">Interaction Design</li>
<li>Interaction Design courses are taken by students across the Division 
of Design, and address the interactions between people 
and technology. Central themes are the role of dynamic 
visualizations, the different views shared by prospective 
users, and the simulation and testing of design concepts.</li>
</ul>
