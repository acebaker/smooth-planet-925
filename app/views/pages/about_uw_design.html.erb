		<p id="program">Within the UW Division of Design there are three majors—Visual Communication Design, Industrial Design and Design Studies—as well as a series of courses in Interaction Design. The division educates and trains designers to create and develop concepts that optimize the function, value, and appearance of communications, products and systems.</p>
		<div id="columncontainer">
			<div class="column">
				<ul>
					<li class="title">Visual Communication Design</li>
					<li>Educates and trains designers for the communication needs of industry and society. Students integrate methodology, aesthetics, technology, materials and audience to develop strategies and solutions. These take the form of print, screen and the built environment.</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li class="title">Design Studies</li>
					<li>Examines design within a multi-disciplinary context. Coursework includes design theory, methodology and case studies, and culminates in a two-course capstone project. Students combine a cross-disciplinary perspective with research, writing and a high level of visual literacy.</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li class="title">Industrial Design</li>
					<li>Makes innovative concepts tangible in the form of products. These take the form of tools, environments or services that are meaningful and useful for society. Observation skills, technical knowledge, and human factors principles all form part of a rich and systematic design process.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="column">
				<ul>
					<li class="title">Master of Fine Arts</li>
					<li>Program is a two-year course leading to a masters degree in industrial design, visual communication design and interaction design. In a cross-disciplinary environment students develop their conceptual skills, experimenting with media and conducting personal design investigation on an advanced level.</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li class="title">Interaction Design</li>
					<li>Courses are taken by students across the Division of Design, and address the interactions between people and technology. Central themes are the role of dynamic visualizations, the different views shared by prospective users, and the simulation and testing of design concepts.</li>
